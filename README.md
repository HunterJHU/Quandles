# Classification of Quandles and Cohomology Groups


This repository contains code written in Python for the paper in pre-print ***Classification of Quandles and Cohomology Groups*** by Mohamed Elhamdadi and Brian Hunter Jackson which is a continuation of the work by L. Vendramin which can be found [here](https://github.com/HunterUSF/Quandles/blob/master/papers/RIG.pdf). We extend his work of classifying all non-isomorphic indecomposable quandles of size < 36, by classifying all non-isomorphic indecomposable quandles up to order 431. We also calculate the cohomology groups of these quandles and create dense finite fields by identifying 2 co-cycles without corresponding coboundaries.

Usage
=====

All code contained within the repository is open-sourced and subject to the GNU [license](https://github.com/HunterUSF/Quandles/blob/master/License.md). The executable files can be found in the cohomology_calculation folder. With a lack of version control, and drastically different approaches we naively maintain multiple versions of the main executable file. Versions ***main_v10.py -- main_v12.py*** run without Sage; however, you will need Sage in order to run ***main_v13.py -- main_v15.py***.
